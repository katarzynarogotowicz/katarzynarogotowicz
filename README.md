# About me
I'm Kasia. I work in IT Business sector for 10 years. I started work as a Technical Writer and Business Analysts. Nowadays I am a Manual Tester. Additionally, I learn new programing languages as HTML and CSS and JavaScript. I use this knowledge in current job, because I work on at PrimeFaces UI Framework. I hope to make my own project related to mentioned Framework.   
I would like to develop in the automation industry. That is why I study and develop in my own project using knowledge of Robot Framework and tools such as Git Bash and PyCharm. I learned Git Bash during the workshop G4G organized by Nokia. My work can be seen on the GitHub platform. I invite you.
